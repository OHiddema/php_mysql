# php_mysql
My first repo using a MySQL database

Step 1:
Create an new, empty database using PDO.

Step 2:
- Install phpMyAdmin, to make it easier to learn SQL, create databases, etc.
- Use '.gitignore' to protect sensitive information like passwords.

Step 3:
- Create a 'laptops' table. The SQL statement was created with phpMyadmin.

Step 4.
- Create a new record in the table laptops.

Step 5.
- When adding a record, also return the id of the last insterted record.
